# Export
Enabling data export to CSV can be achieved with the use of the [List to CSV Download](https://github.com/stadium-software/utils-list-to-csv-download) repo
1. Fetch the data to be exported by executing a query in an event handler or by calling a WebService
2. Assign the results set to the List input property of the *List to CSV Download* module script

**Note: It may be necessary to split large datasets up into smaller batches**
